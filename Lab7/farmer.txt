| ?- size([1,2,3,4],N).
| ?- sumlist([1,2,3,4],N).
| ?- reverse([1,2,3,4],N).

A - Give your output to the three queries above.

    | ?- size([1,2,3,4],N).

    N = 4

    yes
    
    | ?- sumlist([1,2,3,4],N).

    N = 10

    yes
    
    | ?- reverse([1,2,3,4],N).

    N = [4,3,2,1]

    (1 ms) yes

B - Give your output, and then under each of the eight states in the Solution path describe the scenario that has unfolded.

    1 - state(w,w,w,w) = Farmer, wolf, goat, cabbage all on west bank
    2 - state(e,w,e,w) = Farmer takes the goat to the east bank and leavs wolf and cabbage 
    3 - state(w,w,e,w) = Farmer returns alone to the west bank
    4 - state(e,w,e,e) = Farmer takes the cabbage to the east bank, leaving wolf alone on the west bank
    5 - state(w,w,w,e) = Farmer takes the goat back to the west bank
    6 - state(e,e,w,e) = Farmer takes the wolf to the east bank, leaving goat alone on the west bank
    7 - state(w,e,w,e) = Farmer returns to the west bank alone to get the goat
    8 - state(e,e,e,e) = Farmer takes the goat to the east bank

C - What is backtracking? According to the output, where is backtracking enabling recovery from mistakes?

    Backtracking is taking an item from the west bank back to the east bank to prevent the consumption of one of the 
    other items as a result of leaving two items unattended that were described in the problem. The backtracking 
    occurs in the 5th and 6th steps, allowing for the farmer to prevent the goat from eating the cabbage when he's not 
    looking. 

D - A very similar problem is called the Jealous Husbands Problem. Look it up and briefly describe it.

    Imagine three married couples and a small boat eager to cross a river. However, there's a catch â€“ the boat can only 
    carry two people at a time. To complicate matters, if ever on either side of the river there are more husbands than 
    wives (excluding their own), jealousy flares up, and chaos ensues.

    Your task is to figure out a way for all six individuals to cross the river without triggering the husbands' jealousy. 
    It's like orchestrating a delicate dance, ensuring that each couple crosses safely while maintaining harmony and 
    avoiding any emotional turbulence.

    This problem isn't just about getting from point A to point B; it's about navigating complex human dynamics and finding 
    a solution that keeps everyone content. It's a puzzle that tests your strategic thinking and empathy as you balance the needs 
    and emotions of each character in this playful yet challenging scenario.
